# Migration Notes for S.O.S. Repository Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the significant changes made during the repository rehabilitation process. These changes aim to improve code quality, developer experience, and maintainability.

## CI/CD Changes

### Added
- **Workflow Concurrency**: Prevents multiple workflow runs for the same commit/PR
- **Dependency Caching**: Added caching for npm dependencies to speed up builds
- **Matrix Testing**: Support for testing across multiple Node.js versions
- **Automated Documentation**: Automatic deployment of documentation to GitHub Pages
- **Code Coverage**: Integrated Codecov for test coverage reporting
- **Workflow Hygiene**: Added linters for GitHub Actions and YAML files

### Changed
- **Node.js Version**: Standardized on Node.js 20.x LTS
- **Python Version**: Standardized on Python 3.11
- **Test Execution**: Tests now fail the build on failure
- **Build Process**: Separated into distinct jobs for linting, testing, and building

## Documentation

### Added
- **DIAGNOSIS.md**: Comprehensive analysis of the repository state
- **MIGRATION_NOTES.md**: This document
- **README.md**: Updated with better structure and more detailed information
- **GitHub Pages**: Automated deployment of MkDocs documentation

## Tooling

### Added
- **ESLint**: For TypeScript/JavaScript linting
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **YAML Linting**: For GitHub Actions and configuration files
- **Actionlint**: For GitHub Actions validation
- **EditorConfig**: For consistent editor settings

### Updated
- **Dependencies**: Updated to latest stable versions
- **Configuration Files**: Standardized across the project

## Development Workflow

### Changes
1. **Branch Protection**: Main branch is now protected
2. **Required Checks**: All tests must pass before merging
3. **Code Review**: At least one approval required for PRs
4. **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits specification

## How to Update

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm ci
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Run linters
   npm run lint
   
   # Format code
   npm run format
   ```

2. **CI/CD**:
   - Pushes to `main` and `develop` branches trigger CI
   - PRs require all checks to pass
   - Documentation is automatically deployed on merge to `main`

## Known Issues

- Some tests may be flaky and need investigation
- Documentation needs to be expanded in several areas
- Some dependencies have security vulnerabilities that should be addressed

## Next Steps

1. Address any failing tests
2. Expand test coverage
3. Update documentation
4. Set up Dependabot for dependency updates
5. Configure security scanning
